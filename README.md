# BabylonJS on Mapbox

This repo intends to demonstrate how to use a Mapbox custom style layer to render a BabylonJS 3D scene.
We're starting from the [ThreeJS example available on Mapbox's docs](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/add-3d-model/).

## How to use the repo

It's built using Vite, using the vanilla TypeScript template.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
1. Setup your env file: `cp .env.template .env`
1. Get a token from the Mapbox console and add it in. See [this guide](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/dive-deeper/access-tokens/) if you're new to Mapbox.
1. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`.
1. Check the local url the server is running on from the CLI and click it.
